# CS 4050 | Group 2 - Assignment 3

**Created by:** Kene, Skylar, Isaiah.

**Description:** Created a GUI application that loads words from a file, and colors the words in another file depending on whether they were in the former file. It uses a dictionary/hashtable to store words from the original file and tests the words in the other. The hashtable does not use java.util.Hashtable<K,V>, or Object.hashCode() to implement hashing or storage.

**Note:** To run this application, a project needs to be opened from the "Dictionary" folder.
